# TEBot
A bot made to experiment with LUIS and the bot framework. The bot is built to mimic functionality of a website I worked on at http://aka.ms/autechspeakers

The LUIS app has two intents, simply Greeting and FindSpeakers. The bot has the one functionality at the moment to search and return a carousel of AU Technical Evangelists that can speak on a particular topic in a given location.

The bot will be expanded to include MVP's soon.
